# Part 1: The Bare-Metal Workstation

From power-on to a self-hosting development environment — no operating system, no drivers, no standard library. Just raw UEFI, a C compiler, and the knowledge to rebuild.

This part covers building the entire workstation: booting, painting pixels, reading keystrokes, browsing and editing files, compiling C code, and cloning the system to other machines.
