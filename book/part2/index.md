# Part 2: The ESP32 That Saves the World

Part 1 built the workstation. Part 2 answers the next question: how do you get it onto an SD card without a working computer?

A $7 ESP32 with a touchscreen and an SD card slot stores the entire workstation image in its 4 MB flash. Insert a blank card, tap the screen, and walk away with a bootable survival system. No laptop, no internet, no infrastructure required.
